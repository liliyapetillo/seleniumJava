# Description

This project was developed as part of my learning journey with Java and Selenium. After completing a comprehensive course on Udemy, I applied my knowledge to create a real-world testing framework. Utilizing the provided website, I implemented a Page Object Model (POM) approach. Key features of this project include:
You can see use of things like: 
* **Base File**: For reusable methods
* Separate **Page** and **Test** files: For organized code structure
* Control Flow Statements: Incorporated `for` loops and conditional `if` statements
* **TestNG**: For managing test execution
* **Maven Surefire Plugin**: For generating test reports
* Listeners: Enhanced logging with a `takeOnFailureScreenshot` method
* **config.properties** file: For storing reusable data
* Third-Party Library: For generating fake data

# Future Improvements
* Enhanced logging
* Jenkins integration
* Cross-browser support 
* Additional test cases (e.g., account data manipulation, checkout and receipt validation, product selection filtering)

# Running Tests
* Clone the repository
* Install maven to be able to run tests from the terminal `brew install maven`
* Navigate to the project directory and run `mvn test` in the terminal

Alternatively
* Clone the repository
* Execute test suites from your preferred IDE
